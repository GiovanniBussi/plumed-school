What is a bird without a nest?

PLUMED-NEST is the public repository of the PLUMED consortium. It provides all the data needed to reproduce the results of a PLUMED-enhanced molecular dynamics simulation (or analysis) contained in a published paper. Furthermore, PLUMED-NEST monitors the compatibility of the provided PLUMED input files with the current and development versions of the code and integrates links from these files to the PLUMED manual.  Once you have completed a few of the lessons in the PLUMED-TUTORIALS and once you are comfortable with PLUMED syntax you can look through the PLUMED-NEST to find input files that have been used to complete projects that are similar to the ones you will be completing as part of your PhD or PDRA project.
