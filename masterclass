PLUMED Masterclass
------------------

PLUMED Masterclass was a series of virtual and interactive classes, each one
focused on a specific theme ranging from basic concepts to advanced topics in molecular simulations.
Two series of PLUMED Masterclass were run in 2021 and 2022 and were delivered by PLUMED developers and contributors.

Each class was composed by two lectures held on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/): 
* Lecture I: an overview of the methodological background followed by a brief description of the exercises assigned to the students;
* Lecture II: a practical lecture in which the instructor solves the assigned exercises.

In between the two lectures, the participants had one week to complete the exercises on their own or in groups.
They had access to a dedicated [Slack](https://slack.com/) organization, where they were able to
interact with lecturers and with other participants during the entire week.
