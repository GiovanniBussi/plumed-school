A bit of history: PLUMED Masterclass
------------------

<center><img width=150 src="pigeon-MC.png"></center>

PLUMED Masterclass was a series of virtual and interactive classes, each one
focused on a specific theme ranging from basic concepts to advanced topics in molecular simulations.
Two series of PLUMED Masterclass were run in 2021 and 2022 and were delivered by PLUMED developers and contributors.
Overall, the two series of lectures were attended by more than 200 people.

Each Masterclass was composed by two lectures held on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/): 
* Lecture I: an overview of the methodological background followed by a brief description of the exercises assigned to the students;
* Lecture II: a practical lecture in which the instructor solves the assigned exercises.

In between the two lectures, the participants had one week to complete the exercises on their own or in groups.
They had access to a dedicated [Slack](https://slack.com/) organization, where they were able to
interact with lecturers and with other participants during the entire week.

__List of Classes__

Information about the two series of PLUMED Masterclass can be found in the table below. In 2024, these lectures were converted into PLUMED Tutorials, which can be accessed via the link provided below for each series.  All 21 classes are also available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@plumedorg1402). As of August 2024, they have been viewed 46829 times.

| Series | Dates | Classes | Organ<br>izers | Lectu<br>rers | Description |
| :---------: | :---------: | ----------- | :----------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| [2021](https://www.plumed-tutorials.org/browse?search=masterclass-2021) | Jan - May 2021 | 7 | G. Bussi, M. Bonomi, G. A. Tribello | 3 | The first PLUMED Masterclass was developed by three of the core PLUMED developers and was designed to introduce students to basic simulation techniques that can be performed with PLUMED such as block averaging, biased sampling, metadynamics and simulations with multiple replicas.  The final class was an online poster session, in which students presented their own research. |
| [2022](https://www.plumed-tutorials.org/browse?search=masterclass-2022) | Jan - Dec 2022 | 14 | G. Bussi, M. Bonomi | 15 | In the second PLUMED Masterclass we invited people who contributed code to PLUMED to describe what simulations can be performed using their contributed modules. This series focussed on more advanced simulation techniques and less-frequently-employed enhanced sampling methods. The techniques included experimentally-informed molecular dynamics simulations, simulations of crystallisation in solid and from solution, and ligand binding. |
