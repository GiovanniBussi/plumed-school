How to contribute a new lesson to the PLUMED-SCHOOL
---------------------------------------------------
Adding a lesson to the PLUMED-SCHOOL is free and easy. To do so you must:

* Collect the input files that the students will need to run the calculations that they will perform as they complete the exercise.  
* Write a README file in markdown that explains the tasks that the students should work through during the lesson and how they should use the input files you provide.
* Create and upload a zip file containing the inputs and your markdown README file to your favorite repository. Popular solutions are [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and [GitHub](http://github.com). Additional info about where to host your zip file can be found [here](https://github.com/plumed-nest/plumed-nest/blob/master/README.md#zip-info).
* Fill in the sections of the form below. All fields are required, unless otherwise specified.

__Please note that:__

* <b> All contributions are curated and manually uploaded by the coordinators of the PLUMED consortium. Therefore, a delay between submission and online publication should be expected.</b>
* The name and email of the contact person will not appear on the PLUMED-SCHOOL website.
* If necessary, you will be able to edit the information on [GitHub](https://github.com/plumed-school/plumed-school) later or send us a revised version of the form. In the latter case, please specify a list of changes in the "Comments" field.
* PLUMED-SCHOOL will not host your archive, so make sure the indicated URL remains accessible. More info about where to host your contribution can be found [here](https://github.com/plumed-nest/plumed-nest/blob/master/README.md#zip-info).
* PLUMED-SCHOOL does not test whether the exercises in your lesson are executed correctly.  It only tests whether the PLUMED can parse the input files you provided in the README instructions.
