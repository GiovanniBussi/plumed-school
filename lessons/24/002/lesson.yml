title: Trans-Cis isomerization in the ground and excited states using PLUMED
description: This tutorial shows how to run ground and excited state simulations using PLUMED patched with your MD code to simulate a trans to cis isomerization process. The flow chart will guide on the order to consult the resources, that you can easily access by clicking on them.
